# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a single page application built with React, where users can create, edit, and delete an interview in the afternoon each weekday. Interview Scheduler makes API requests to load and persist data, when both servers run concurrently; requests are proxied from the Webpack development server to the API server.
